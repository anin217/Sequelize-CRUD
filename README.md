# Sequelize-CRUD
A simple rest api using Node.js Express , Sequelize and MySQL

This project is a testing on the sequelize ORM for node.js. You can play around with the CRUD operations using postman (port 3000).
API routes :
/api/all - GET 
/api/new - POST
/api/update/:id - PUT
/api/delete/:id - DELETE

Only GET and POST method is implemented in the front-end. The front end is tweaked a little with bootstrap for better visualisation.
Please ensure that the db name in the config.js in config folder for dev mode is same as the one created in MySQL.
